# FortiGate Autoscale for Azure

A collection of **Node.js** modules and cloud-specific templates which support auto scaling functionality for groups of FortiGate-VM instances on various cloud platforms.

This project contains the code and templates for the **Microsoft Azure** deployment. For deployment on other cloud platforms, visit the relevant repository:
* The **AliCloud** deployment is in the  [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
* The **Amazon AWS** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-aws](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws) repository.
* The **GCP** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-gcp](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-gcp) repository.

This project is organized in separate node modules:

 * [autoscale-core](https://github.com/fortinet/autoscale-core) contains the core logic and provides an interface that can be extended to deal with the differences in cloud platform APIs.

 * [fortigate-autoscale-azure](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-azure) contains an implementation for the **Microsoft Azure** platform API and **Cosmos DB** storage backend.


The project also contains a deployment script that can generate packages for each cloud service's *serverless* implementation.
